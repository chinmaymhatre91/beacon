Open Networking Laboratory (On.Lab) FOSS License Exception

On.Lab's Free and Open Source Software ("FOSS") License Exception allows
developers of FOSS applications to combine those applications with the Beacon
controller. The Beacon controller is made available by On.Lab under version 2
of the GNU General Public License (GPL), with the following additional
permission.  Any redistribution of this software must include this additional
permission.

On.Lab's FOSS License Exception

1. "Program" means a Beacon controller source code file that contains a copy of
this FOSS License Exception notice.

2. "FOSS Application" means an application that uses the functionality provided
by the Program via the Beacon API and is made available under an Approved FOSS
License.

3. "Approved FOSS License" means one or more of the following licenses: GNU
General Public License (version 2 or 3) ("GPL:)", GNU Lesser General Public
License (version 2 or 3), Apache Software License 1.1, Apache License 2.0,
Mozilla Public License (version 1.1 or later), Eclipse Public License (version
1.0), Common Public License (version 1.0), Common Development and Distribution
License (version 1.0), MIT, BSD, New BSD, or OpenFlow license.

4. "Beacon API" means the Program's documented programmatic interface through
which one or more of Beacon's functional blocks of software communicates with
applications.

5.  You may distribute a Foss Application based on the Program provided that: 
  a.  You abide by the requirements of the GPL for the Program and all
derivative works thereof, excluding any FOSS Application; and 
  b. You distribute any FOSS Application only under an Approved FOSS License.

FAQ

Q: Why did you create this FOSS License Exception?
A: We want to encourage developers to write and share applications for our
Beacon controller, even if they cannot or do not wish to release those
applications under GPL. 

Q: Why did you limit the list of Approved FOSS Licenses to those above?
A: We chose the most popular and widely accepted open source licenses.

Q: Can I re-license the Beacon controller under regular GPL without the
exception?  
A: No.  You must apply the exception and may not impose any further
restrictions.  (GPL without the exception would be a further restriction.)  We
want to avoid forking of this code base, and if you distribute your changes
under GPL without our exception, we would not be able to share your
modifications with others.  

Q: Can I distribute an open source application that uses Beacon API?  
A: Yes, as long any application that integrates directly with the Program (for
instance, that uses the Program in a JAR file) is made available under an
Approved FOSS License.

Q: Can I distribute a proprietary application that uses the Beacon API?
A: No, unless your application is an Approved License, it will violate GPL and
the terms of our exception.  Keep in mind that using the Beacon API requires
the use of some or all of the Program, so you cannot distribute an application
that uses the Beacon API without complying with our license terms for that
application.

Q: What if my application is under a more restrictive license like GPL or
Affero GPL?  Doesn't that convert Beacon to be licensed under my more
restrictive terms?
A: No.  If you release your application under GPL, you must allow others to
redistribute the Beacon controller under GPL with our FOSS exception, or they
cannot distribute both together.  Nothing gives you the right to change our
licensing terms.  You cannot distribute our Beacon controller with an
application under an Affero GPL license, because it is not an Approved FOSS
License.

Q: If I am working for a public institution such as a university, or in a
non-commercial setting, can I share changes with others for research purposes?
A:  Unless you comply with the terms of the exception, no.  But if you wish to
do so, and need to share a proprietary application, please contact us.  We will
consider requests on a case-by-case basis.  Although we cannot promise we will
approve, we want to encourage sharing by research institutions, and understand
that some may not be able to release their applications under an Approved FOSS
License.

Q: What if I want to license my application under an open source license that
is not an Approved FOSS License?
A:  Please contact us.  We may consider granting you an exception on a
case-by-case basis.  But we suggest that you consider dual-licensing under an
Approved FOSS License.

Q: What if I want to license the Beacon controller under a different open
source license?
A:  Please contact us, but we are unlikely to approve such a request unless you
want to use a license more restrictive than ours.  We may consider granting you
an exception on a case-by-case basis.

Q: If I have more questions, whom should I contact?
A: For more information, please contact Nick McKeown (nickm@stanford.edu).
